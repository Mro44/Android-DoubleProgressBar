# Android Double Progress Bar #

## Purpose ##

While developing an Android App I needed a widget to show two progress
bars at the same time. One to show the overall progress and another to
show the intermediate progress.

I first tried to extend the ProgressBar class included with the
Android SDK which didn't work out because of the fields in ProgressBar
are defined as private.

I then used the code in ProgressDialog.java directly, extending
AlertDialog and overriding `setSecondaryProgress` so it updates the
second progress bar instead of drawing another bar behind the primary
progress bar.

## Example ##

The following screenshot illustrates how this widget looks using the
included example project.

## How to use ##

The usage is actually pretty simple:

1. Copy DoubleProgressBar.java to your classpath
3. Copy the included `res/layout/alert_dialog_double_progress.xml`
   file to your `res/layout` folder.
2. Adjust `package com.simaomata;` to match your package.
3. Create a new DoubleProgress bar as needed.

        progressDialog = new DoubleProgressDialog(this);
        progressDialog.setMessage("Double progress test");
        progressDialog.setCancelable(true);
        progressDialog.setButton("Cancel", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(DialogInterface dialogInterface, int i) {
                dialogInterface.cancel();
            }
        });
        progressDialog.show();

4. Set primary and secondary progress using the appropriate methods,
always using a progress values ranging from 0 to 100.

        progressDialog.setProgress(64);
        progressDialog.setSecondaryProgress(32);
    

## Drawbacks and future improvements ##

There are some rough edges,

* Only tested under Android SDK API Level 2.1
* Only tested when directly feeding the calculated percentage to
  setProgress and setSecondaryProgess, withouth using setMax.
